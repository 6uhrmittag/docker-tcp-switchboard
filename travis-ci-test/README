The travis test runs docker inside docker.
In the outer container, we run docker and the switchboard.
The inner containers run echoserv and upperserv.

runtest.sh starts docker, builds the images for the inner containers,
starts the switchboard and then runs client.py, which runs the tests
against echoserv and upperserv.
